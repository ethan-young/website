Exposure to stress early in childhood or the accumulation of stress across the lifespan may be responsible for this pattern. However, the relative impact of life stress during distinct life stages on diurnal cortisol is unknown. Using a longitudinal sample of adults followed from birth, we examine three stress exposure models on diurnal cortisol: the cumulative stress model (CM), the biological embedding model (BEM), and the sensitization model (SM). The CM targets cumulative life stress, the BEM implicates early childhood stress, and the SM suggests current stress interacts with early life stress to produce flat diurnal cortisol slopes. Analyses indicate that high early stress exposure and high current stress predict flat diurnal cortisol slopes, consistent with the SM. These novel findings advance our understanding of diurnal cortisol patterns and highlight avenues for intervention.</em></p></div></div></div></ul></td></tr><tr ><tr ><td style = 'border-style: none none solid none;border-width: 1px 1px 1px 1px;border-color: rgba(0,0,0,.05);'><b></b></td><td style = 'border-style: none none solid none;border-width: 1px 1px 1px 1px;border-color: rgba(0,0,0,.05);'><ul><li>Farrell, A.

A person's mind may instead become developmentally specialized and potentially enhanced for solving problems in the types of environments in which the person grew up. In the current research, we tested whether these specialized advantages in cognitive function might be sensitized to emerge in currently uncertain contexts. We refer to this as the sensitized-specialization hypothesis. We conducted experimental tests of this hypothesis in the domain of working memory, examining how growing up in unpredictable versus predictable environments affects different facets of working memory. Although growing up in an unpredictable environment is typically associated with impairments in working memory, we show that this type of environment is positively associated with those aspects of working memory that are useful in rapidly changing environments. Importantly, these effects emerged only when the current context was uncertain. These theoretically derived findings suggest that childhood environments shape, rather than uniformly impair, cognitive functions.</em></p></div></div></div></ul></td></tr><tr ><tr ><td style = 'border-style: none none solid none;border-width: 1px 1px 1px 1px;border-color: rgba(0,0,0,.05);'><b></b></td><td style = 'border-style: none none solid none;border-width: 1px 1px 1px 1px;border-color: rgba(0,0,0,.05);'><ul><li>Martin, J., Anderson, J.

However, no studies to date have investigated this key premise using prospective data. To address this gap, we discuss evolutionary-based models of attachment and use them to examine how secure versus insecure children might score differently on Big 5 traits that underlie the meta-trait stability. We modeled data from Minnesota Longitudinal Study of Risk and Adaptation (N = 170), which has followed participants across 30 years. Participant’s early attachment status was assessed in Ainsworth’s Strange at 12 and 18 months and personality was assessed on Big 5 measures at age 32. Being securely attached early in childhood predicted three of the Big 5 traits known to tap the meta-trait stability. Specifically, participants rated as secure early in life scored higher on agreeableness and conscientiousness and lower on neuroticism in adulthood, whereas those rated as insecure scored lower on agreeableness and conscientiousness and higher on neuroticism. Exploratory mediation analyses revealed that neither adult attachment representations nor internalizing/externalizing symptoms mediated the association between early security and stability. The implications of these findings for understanding the origins of personality variation are discussed.</em></p></div></div></div></ul></td></tr><tr ><tr ><td style = 'border-style: none none solid none;border-width: 1px 1px 1px 1px;border-color: rgba(0,0,0,.05);'><b></b></td><td style = 'border-style: none none solid none;border-width: 1px 1px 1px 1px;border-color: rgba(0,0,0,.05);'><ul><li>Szepsenwol, O., Griskevicius, V., Simpson, J.

Highly predictable (sta- ble) environments should increase the potential fitness benefits of long-term (slow) mating strategies as well as the potential costs of short-term (fast) mating strategies. Experiencing a more predictable childhood environment, therefore, should lead individuals to enact a slower life history strategy characterized by more restricted sociosexual behaviors. We tested this hypothesis in the Minnesota Longitudinal Study of Risk and Adaptation (MLSRA), an ongoing longitudinal study that has followed individuals from before they were born into adulthood. Indicators of sociosexuality in early adulthood were assessed by trained coders based on inter- views conducted with participants about their current relationship, their relation- ship history, and their future relationship aspirations when they were 23 years old. The findings revealed that having experienced more predictable environments during the first 4 years of life (indexed by less frequent changes in parents’ employment status, cohabitation status, and residence) prospectively predicted more restricted sociosexuality at age 23, over and above current levels of predict- ability (that also uniquely predicted restricted sociosexuality at age 23). This early life predictability effect was partially mediated by greater early maternal support and being securely attached at age 19. Viewed together, these findings suggest that greater predictability early in life may be partially conveyed to children through more supportive parenting, which results in secure attachment in adolescence, which in turn predicts more restricted sociosexuality in early adulthood.</em></p></div></div></div></ul></td></tr><tr ><tr ><td style = 'border-style: none none  none;border-width: 1px 1px 1px 1px;border-color: rgba(0,0,0,.05);'><b>2015</b></td><td style = 'border-style: none none  none;border-width: 1px 1px 1px 1px;border-color: rgba(0,0,0,.05);'><ul><li>Mittal, C., Griskevicius, V., Simpson, J.

Drawing participants from higher-income and lower-income backgrounds, we tested how adults who grew up in harsh or unpredictable environments fared on 2 types of executive function tasks: inhibition and shifting. People who experienced unpredictable childhoods performed worse at inhibition (overriding dominant responses), but performed better at shifting (efficiently switching between different tasks). This finding is consistent with the notion that shifting, but not inhibition, is especially useful in unpredictable environments. Importantly, differences in executive function between people who experienced unpredictable versus predictable childhoods emerged only when they were tested in uncertain contexts. This catalyst suggests that some individual differences related to early life experience are manifested under conditions of uncertainty in adulthood. Viewed as a whole, these findings indicate that adverse childhood environments do not universally impair mental functioning, but can actually enhance specific types of cognitive performance in the face of uncertainty.</em></p></div></div></div></ul></td></tr></table>
