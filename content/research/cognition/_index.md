Stressful environments have a profound impact on children. The prevailing view is that adverse experiences in childhood impairs the mind and derails development. In contrast, this research draws on the *the specialization hypothesis*, which proposes that children should develop specialized cognitive abilities that are adapted to stress. This view focuses on the strengths of people from adversity instead of exclusively on their weaknesses. This project seeks to test how different learning abilities are enhanced by early adversity. This research is important because it could help identify the types of cognitive abilities and strategies that are most effective for success among students from disadvantaged backgrounds.

The basic question that this research asks is:
